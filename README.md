# Design Tool based on SOFA physics Engine for Simulating the Ionic conducting polymer
Design Tool based on SOFA physics engine Simulation for Soft Miniaturized Actuator 
This is a design tool based on SOFA physics Engines for simulating the behavior of the ionic conductive polymer actuator. In this files, there are two validated test which is the stiffness test for measuring the youngModulus at different points of the ionic conductive polymer. 

The other test is the voltage test validation of the ionic conductive polymer.
The objective of this tool is to facilitate the method of designing soft smart actuator through simulating its physical behavior based on different structure. The outcomes of the physics engine tool it will enable us to know the accurate physcial parameters of different miniaturized soft actuators based on their validated physical properties.
